# libstree a library for suffix trees
This is a fork of the [libstree library](http://www.icir.org/christian/libstree/) by Christian Kreibich.
The primary purpose of this form is to provide a permanent location for this small, performant implementation
of suffix trees and ensure its perl API [Tree::Suffix](https://metacpan.org/pod/Tree::Suffix) continues to work .
Note that the library is considered to have many bugs, and the reason to keep this library around is for 
educational purposes. Per the original documentation, the suffix tree implementation follows Dan Gusfield's book
"Algorithms on Strings and Trees", CUP 1997/
